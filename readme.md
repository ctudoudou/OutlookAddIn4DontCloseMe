# OutlookAddIn4DontCloseMe

[简体中文](./readme-zh.md) | [正體中文](./readme-zh-TW.md)

A plugin for Outlook 2013/2016 and above that prevents accidental shutdown.

I just wrote this plugin to prevent accidental shutdown of Outlook.

## Installation

You can download the latest version of the plugin directly at [here](https://github.com/ctudoudou/OutlookAddIn4DontCloseMe/releases). If you are not comfortable with the security of the compiled plugin, you can download the source code and compile it yourself using Visual Studio 2015 or later.

## Instructions

When you click directly to close, Outlook will automatically restart in the background by default in a minimal way, without worrying about actually shutting down.

If you really want to close Outlook, you can completely close Outlook by holding down the `Shift`+Close button.
